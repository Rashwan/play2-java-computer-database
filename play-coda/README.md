Play 2.1 computer database sample
=====================================

This is a classic CRUD application, backed by a JDBC database. It's based on the
computer database sample from the play distribution and adds some more features.

It demonstrates:

* Accessing a JDBC database, using Ebean.
* Table pagination and CRUD forms.
* Integrating with a CSS framework (Twitter Bootstrap ).

Additionally to the play sample, it also shows:
* Asset compilation (coffee script)
* JavaScript reverse routing (used for ajax calls)
* RequireJS integration
* Asynchronous request handling (blocking, non-blocking)

First [install play](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/Installing), then just run `play` and in the play/sbt shell `run`.
