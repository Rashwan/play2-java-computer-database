# Play 2 Computer Database Sample

This is the demo code for my Play Framework 2 presentation at JAX 2013 ([slides](http://www.slideshare.net/martin_grotzke/jax2013-play2). It's based on the computer-database sample shipped with the play distribution, modified to show more features.

`play-coda/` is the sample code itself, `coda-backend/` is the webservice
used for comparison of sync/async WS usage.
